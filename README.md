# Description

This bot pits two entities against each other (either fictional characters or public figures) in various battle or competition scenarios such as a rap battle or a Food Network Chopped competition. These "entities" are picked randomly from an array of fictional characters and public figures.

It will first tweet the question, here I have chosen tweets to come out every hour. Once the question is posed, the bot will tweet the winner after a set time. For this example I have chosen 45 minutes.

It's amusing to think of the outcome in these hypothetical battles, and debate which character/person would win. The idea is that people would be able to interact with the bot and like the tweet to vote character 1 or retweet to vote character 2.

The next step for this project would be to include a method that counts the number of retweets and the number of likes the question has, and calculate the winner based off of those numbers.
